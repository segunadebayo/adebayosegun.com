When writing tests, you might need to copy and paste some text. Playwright has a nice API for that.

```ts
test('on paste should autofill', async ({ page, context }) => {
  // grant access to clipboard (you can also set this in the playwright.config.ts file)
  await context.grantPermissions(['clipboard-read', 'clipboard-write']);

  // focus on the input
  await page.locator('input').focus();

  // copy text to clipboard
  await page.evaluate(() => navigator.clipboard.writeText('123'));

  // Get clipboard content
  const handle = await page.evaluateHandle(() => navigator.clipboard.readText());
  const clipboardContent = await handle.jsonValue();

  // paste text from clipboard
  await page.locator(first).press('Meta+v');

  // check if the input has the value
  await expect(page.locator(input)).toHaveValue('123');
});
```

To grant access globally, you can set it in the playwright.config.ts file:

```ts
import type { PlaywrightTestConfig } from '@playwright/test';

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  use: {
    //...
    permissions: ['clipboard-read'],
  },
};

export default config;
```
